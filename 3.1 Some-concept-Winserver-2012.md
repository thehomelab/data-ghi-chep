##  1. ISATAP

 - ISATAP enables unicast communication between IPv6/IPv4 hosts across
   the IPv4-only Internet. ISATAP works by encapsulating IPv6 packets
   with an IPv4 header so that the IPv6 packet can be sent over an
   IPv4-only network. This approach is called IPv6-over- IPv4
   ­tunneling, and ISATAP uses automatic tunneling that does not require
   any manual configuration

### 2. Hyper-V virtualization
- Virtualization is rapidly becoming the essential foundation for today’s datacenter
environments. Both private and public cloud computing are based on virtualization
technologies, as is the emerging virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) paradigm that can
provide benefits beyond those provided by traditional desktop computing for certain
scenarios. Being able to implement and manage a virtualization infrastructure, therefore, is
becoming a key job role for datacenter administrators.
- The Hyper-V server role of Microsoft Windows Server provides an out-of-the-box
platform for virtualizing both server workloads and virtual desktops. The numerous
enhancements and improvements made to Hyper-V in Windows Server 2012 now make it
easier than ever to deploy, configure, manage, and maintain an organization’s virtualized
computing infrastructure. This chapter demonstrates how to deploy and manage virtual-
ization hosts and virtual machines using both the GUI administration tools and Windows
PowerShell cmdlets included in Windows Server 2012.


### 3. Hyper-v Network


	
- Private  :  This type of virtual switch allows virtual machines running on the host to
communicate only with each other and not with the operating system of the host. A
private virtual switch is not bound to any physical network adapter on the host, which
means that the virtual machines on the host cannot communicate with any other
system on any physical network connected to the host.
- Internal : This type of virtual switch allows virtual machines running on the host to
communicate with each other and with the operating system of the host. An internal
virtual switch is not bound to any physical network adapter on the host, which means
that the virtual machines on the host cannot communicate with any other system on
any physical network connected to the host.
- External  : Unlike the other two types of virtual switches listed, this type is bound to
a physical network adapter on the host. The result is that an external virtual switch
allows virtual machines running on the host to communicate with each other, with the ­operating system of the host, and with other systems on the physical network connected to the host through that adapter. ( go to the internet ) 


### 4. Hyper-V virtual disk 

- There 2 type vDisk in hyper-v :
	- Fixed-size  : This type of virtual hard disk has its image file pre-allocated on the
physical storage device for the maximum size requested when the disk is created. For
example, a 250-GB, fixed-size virtual hard disk will occupy 250 GBs of space on the
host’s storage device.
	- Dynamically expanding :  This type of virtual hard disk uses only as much ­physical
storage space as it needs to store the actual data that the disk currently contains.
The size of the virtual disk’s image file then grows as additional data is written to it.

- For ­example, the image file for a dynamic virtual hard disk of a newly created vir-
tual machine that has no operating system installed on it has a size of only 4 MBs
even though its maximum size is configured with the default value of 127 GBs. Once
Windows Server 2012 has been installed as the guest operating system, however,
the size of the virtual disk’s image file will grow to more than 8 GBs. See Lesson 3
in this chapter for information on how to expand, compact, or shrink dynamically
expanding  disks.

- Whether to use virtual hard disks that use the VHD disk format used by previous
versions of Hyper-V or the newer VHDX format introduced in Windows Server 2012.
Although the older VHD format supported virtual hard disks up to 2040 GBs in size,
the newer VHDX format now supports virtual hard disks up to 64 TBs in size


### 5. Windows Deployment Services 

-Windows Deployment Services (WDS) is a software platform and technology that allows
you to perform automated network-based installations based on network-based boot and
installation media. In other words, you can perform an installation over a network with no
operating system or local boot device on it. The WDS server will store the installation files
and help you manage the boot and operating system image files used in the network installa-
tions. Although WDS is included with later versions of Windows Server, including Windows
Server 2012, it can be used to deploy Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8,
Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2012

- For client computers to communicate with a WDS server without an operating system, the
client computer must have support preboot execution environment (PXE), pronounced
“pixie.” PXE is a technology that boots computers using the network interface without a
data storage device, such as a hard drive or an installed operating system. For a computer
to perform a PXE boot, you must configure the BIOS setup program to perform a network
boot. Depending on your system, you must enable the PXE boot and/or change the boot
order so that the PXE boot occurs before the system tries other boot devices to boot from.
When PXE is used with WDS, the client computer downloads a boot image that loads Windows
Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE). Windows PE is a minimal Windows operating
system with limited services. Windows PE is then used to install the operating system using an
operating system image file. Windows PE 4.0 is based on the Windows 8 operating system.


## 6. Windows Updates and Automatic Updates

- Windows is a complicated system with many components and files. To keep Windows
reliable and secure, you must check whether Microsoft has released any Windows updates,
including fixes, patches, service packs, and updated device drivers. If updates are available,
you should apply them to your Windows system. By adding fixes and patches, you’ll keep
Windows stable and secure.

- One way to keep Windows up to date is to use the Windows Update program, which scans
your system to determine the updates and fixes your system needs. You then have the oppor-
tunity to select, download, and install each update.
- Administrators of corporate networks can also use Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)—each covered in more detail later in this
lesson—to keep your systems updated. The advantage of using one of these systems is that it
allows you to test the patch, schedule updates, and prioritize client updates. Once you deter-
mine a patch is safe, you can enable the patch for deployment.

- Microsoft classifies updates as Important, Recommended, or Optional:
	- Important updates: These updates offer significant benefits, such as improved security,
privacy, and reliability. They should be installed as they become available and can be
installed automatically with Windows Update.
	- Recommended updates: These updates address noncritical problems or help enhance
your computing experience. Although these updates do not address fundamental issues
with your computer or Windows software, they can offer meaningful improvements.
	- Optional updates: These include updates, drivers, or new software from Microsoft to
enhance your computing experience. You need to install these manually.
